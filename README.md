## Description

This project is about building an online project tracker that uses the Kanban approach, which is common in agile development. Put simply, a Kanban board lets team members move discrete chunks of work between columns that communicate a status, such as To Do, In Progress, or Complete. The project is aligned with a principile of identifying document object and its relationship to HTML. It majorly uses a DOM API method to select and dynamically generate HTML elements and content. It majorly contains an event-driven function to enable to perform the DOM manupilation. At the end it also demonstartes the skills how persistently use local storage to keep tasks in a responding status page or list.
